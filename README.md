This is a tutorial for Wapiki, a tool for CRF implementation. 

The proper way to use the materials in the tutorial:

Step 1. Read the text book.
Klinger, Roman, and Katrin Tomanek. Classical probabilistic models and conditional random fields. TU, Algorithm Engineering, 2007.

(The theorem part of CRF is given in the graduate course in HZAU, i.e., "Bio text mining and knowledge discovery", in every Spring.)


Step 2. Follow the experiment tutorial. CRF实验.pdf
The tutorial is offered by @KaiyinZhou.
